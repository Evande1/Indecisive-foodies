# Indecisive-foodies
Orbital 2022



NUS ORBITAL 2022 - Milestone 1

Proposed Level of Achievement:
Project Apollo

Motivation:
We have very indecisive friends who take a long time to decide on what to eat. As such, a lot of time is wasted on this and we hope that we can create something to solve this problem. Often, students suffer from analysis paralysis in all sorts of decisions. We want to decrease the number of decisions that students need to make especially on food choices so they can focus on the more important stuff.
Aim:

User Stories:
As a user, I want to easily get a randomly selected food choice.
As a user, I want to categorise my food choices.
As a user, I want to insert my own food choices and categorise them.
As a user, I want to navigate around the application easily and intuitively.
As a user, I want this application to be convenient and be able to use it through a telegram bot.
As a user, I want to automatically pick the next 7 days of food and save it in my calendar.
Scope of Project:

The web app allows users to pick a randomly selected food based on the category.

Features:

Random Generator with a button to start the selection and a dropdown menu for users to select the category
Form for users to enter the name of the food and choose the category of the entered food.
Database: Store all food items and users


Tech Stack
ReactJS (Frontend)
Express + Node.js (Backend)
MongoDB
Telegraf (Telegram Bot API, JS library) (Optional)
Calendar API

Special features:
Calendar list for a week
Instead of needing to open the application and select a food every meal, the user is able to select their 3 meals for the next 7 days and save it on google calendar.
Telegram API
Able to use the Telegram Bot to retrieve a random food choice

Development Plan:
Initial design for poster and videos ( Week 1)
Come up with potential features ( Week 2)
Learn relevant tech (right after exams) (Week 3)
Wireframe (Week 4)
Build random generator ( Week 5 - 7)
Build Telegram bot and calendar ( Week 8,9)
